    <h1>How to play Khet</h1>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Khet is a two-player game. The object of the game is to hit the opponent's pharoah piece with a laser while protecting your own. On your turn, you may move a piece a single square or rotate it ninety degrees. Pieces act as mirrors to steer the laser.</p>
    <p>Khet is played on a 10 square by 8 square board by two players, <b>silver</b> (blueish on this site) and <b>red</b> (orangeish). Some of the squares on the board are also silver and red.</p>
    <p>The <b>files</b> (columns) are labelled <b>a&ndash;j</b> starting from the left and the <b>ranks</b> (rows) are labelled <b>1&ndash;8</b> starting from the bottom. Squares on the board are named by their file plus rank.</p>

    <p>There are four types of piece in Khet, which each occupy a single square: <b>pharoahs</b>, <b>djeds</b>, <b>pyramids</b>, and <b>obelisks</b>. Obelisks can <b>stack</b> so that two sit on one square. Each piece is either silver or red.</p>

    <p>Each game is a sequence of <b>moves</b> which are each composed of two <b>plies</b> (turns). Silver always starts. Each ply, a player either moves or rotates a single piece. Every piece moves one space either orthogonally or diagonally. The destination must be empty of pieces, except that djeds switch places with pieces in squares they move into. Rotations are always ninety degrees and can be either clockwise or anticlockwise. A silver piece may not move into a red square and a red piece may not move into a silver square.</p>

    <p>After every ply, the current player's laser is fired. Silver's laser is at the bottom-right and shines up, red's laser is at the top-left and shines down. The laser bounces harmlessly off the diagonal sides of pieces at ninety degree angles until it hits either the flat side of a piece or the edge of the board. If it hits a piece, that piece is removed from play (the laser does not continue after this). If a player's pharoah is hit by the laser, that player loses. If the laser hits two stacked obelisks, both are removed from play.</p>
