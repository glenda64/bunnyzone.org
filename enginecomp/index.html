		<p>Welcome to the web site for the Khet engine competition :)</p>
		<p>Khet is a two-player abstract strategy game with LASERS :OOOOO</p>
		<p>Your challenge is to write a program (<i>engine</i>) that plays Khet to compete in a tournament with other engines, submitted by other contestants. Trophies and t-shirts will be awarded for multiple prize categories! <i>(designs TBD)</i></p>
		<p>Engine rules: <i>(subject to change)</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>You may write your engine in any language if its compiler or interpreter is available for Alpine Linux. Do not use a nightly or bleeding edge version.</li>
			<li>You may use any external libraries except those that evaluate moves or board states. Please link dynamically to libc and statically to everything else. You may not call any external programs.</li>
			<li>You may not use more than 500M of memory or 500M of disk space. You may not read or write any files, use the network, or use graphics. Your program will be built and run on an Alpine Linux virtual machine.</li>
			<li>You're free to compete as a team, and there are up to three t-shirts per winning entry.</li>
			<li>If you submit your engine on or before <b>28 Nov</b> I'll evaluate it to make sure it follows the rules. Invalid submissions after that time will be insta-disqualified. Final submissions are due by <b>30 Nov</b> at midnight in Vancouver. Winners will be announced <b>2 Dec</b>, and I'll release a complete update on how everyone placed, including detailed breakdowns</li>
			<li>Your engine must use the <a href="format.html">tournament communication format</a> to interface with the tournament program.</li>
			<li>The tournament is double-elimination (if an engine loses a matchup, it moves to a "losers' bracket")</li>
			<li>Please also see the <a href="khet.html">Khet rules</a>! Some are specific to this tournament, including <b>time control</b>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Prize categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Smartest:</b> the engine that wins the tournament.</li>
			<li><b>Quickest Wit:</b> the engine in the final 25% of rounds (rounding up) that takes the least time to move.</li>
			<li><b>Most Improved:</b> the engine eliminated in the first round that shows the best performance in the losers' bracket.</li>
			<li><b>Most Interesting:</b> the engine with the most interesting strategy as subjectively judged by me.</li>
			<li><b>Most Lopsided:</b> the engine that has the highest ratio of wins as one colour to wins as the other colour.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please email <b><nobr>engines&nbsp;()&nbsp;bunnyzone&nbsp;!&nbsp;org</nobr></b> as a courtesy if you plan to participate :)</p>
